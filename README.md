**Problem Statement and Project Description**

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

ðŸ’¾**Project Files Description**

This project contains one executable file, a technical Summary document.

**Executable Files**

1.Abhyuday-Netflix Movies and Tv shows Clustering  - Google Collab notebook containing data summary, exploration, visualisations and modeling,containg model hyperparameter tuning, model performance, evaluation and conclusion.

2.Summarynmtv.pdf- Includes the Summary about the project.

**ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. The distribution of content types in the dataset, with 69.14% of the content being movies and 30.86% being TV shows. This information can be useful for understanding the overall content offering of Netflix and could potentially inform decisions related to content acquisition and production. Additionally, this information may be of interest to users who are looking to explore the range of content available on the platform.

2. The analysis of the titles of movies and TV shows showed that certain words are repeated more frequently such as Christmas, Love, World, Man, and Story. The presence of the word Christmas in the titles could be explained by the fact that most of the content is uploaded during winters, which is the holiday season.

3. United States and the United Kingdom, the two nations show a high degree of alignment. However, when compared to nations like India or Japan, the target ages are radically different. This observation indicates that there may be significant cultural differences in entertainment preferences between these nations.

ðŸ“ˆ **Results**

* Using the similarity matrix obtained from the cosine similarity calculation, a content-based recommendation system was built. This system analyzes the user's watched shows to identify similar shows in the dataset and provides 10 recommendations to the user based on their viewing history with their respective Similarity scores
this clustering and recommendation system is designed to improve the user's streaming experience by suggesting relevant content based on their interests and viewing history.
